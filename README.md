HTML5 Canvas
============

A Dart port of the HTML5 Canvas (2nd Edition) Samples. The samples contained
here are all based entirely off of the works: HTML5 Canvas, Second Edition
by Steve Fulton and Jeff Fulton (O'Reilly). Copyright 2013 8bitrocket Studios
ISBN: 978-1-449-33498-7. The samples are reproduced under the MIT License

About The Port
--------------

The aim of this project is to provide Dart versions of the examples used in
the *HTML5 Canvas (2nd Edition)*. Where possible I've remained true to the
examples rather than implementing any optimizations. However I have tried to 
use common Dart idioms whenever I can. The original goal of the book is to
teach readers the HTML5 Canvas and related APIs, not game programming
optimizations.
(Also see Bob Nystrom's book in progress: [Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/))

The examples are located in the web/ directory per Pub's 
[Package Layout Conventions](http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/package-layout.html).
Within that directory, each chapter is broken down into its own directory.
In chapter 1, I have omitted the first couple of samples as they do not 
pertain directly to Dart. I have included the base template used for many
of the samples.

I varied from the book samples by keeping the HTML, stylesheets and Dart code
in their own separate files to more clearly display the specific code.
Additionally I find this helps conceptionally when compiling to JavaScript.

While the source is heavily commented, I **highly** recommend that you read 
[HTML5 Canvas, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026266.do) while
following the samples. They have also generously made this book available for 
[reading online](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001654/index.html).
